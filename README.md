# Renewable Energy Visualization & Analysis

This is a completed data analysis project exploring renewable energy adoption and carbon emission reduction across 10 major countries from 2000 to 2023. It was developed as the final portfolio assignment for the **FC724 Programming Practical Application** module and received a final score of **94/100**.

## 🌍 Project Overview

The project analyzes trends and relationships in renewable energy usage and government investment, using data from countries including China, the UK, the US, Germany, India, and more. It applies core Python data processing and visualization libraries to extract meaningful insights.

### 📌 Key Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw data using `pandas`
- Store and query structured data with `SQLite`
- Create professional visualizations with `matplotlib`
- Identify trends in renewable energy adoption and emission reduction
- Explore the correlation between investment and outcomes

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9**
- **pandas** for data preprocessing
- **SQLite** for database storage and querying
- **matplotlib** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for code organization and documentation

## 📊 Project Features

- Missing value imputation using median and mean strategies
- Structured SQLite database for efficient data storage
- Line charts for trend visualization across years and countries
- Heatmaps for global comparison of renewable energy share
- Scatter plots with regression analysis (e.g., investment vs. adoption rate)
- Stacked bar charts for renewable energy source composition by country

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Significant renewable energy growth observed post-2010 and post-2020
- Strong positive correlation between renewable energy adoption and emission reduction in most countries
- Government investment alone does not ensure higher adoption — policy consistency and infrastructure matter more

## 📝 Author Note

This project was created as a hands-on experience to apply Python in real-world data analysis scenarios. Through this work, I strengthened my understanding of data cleaning, database handling, and professional visualization — skills I intend to apply in future data-driven roles.
